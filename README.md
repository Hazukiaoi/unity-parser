# Unity Parser

Highly experimental UnityBundle, UnityAsset parser in Node.js.

This is not an universal unity parser, but designed for [some specific game](http://cinderella.idolmaster.jp/sl-stage/). If you are going to parse *other game*'s resource files and *other game* is using Unity `5.1.2f`, it may work. Otherwise, it might not work.

Work in progress.
